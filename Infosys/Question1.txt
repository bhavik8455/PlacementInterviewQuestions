Problem Statement : 
You are an artist, and your palette is in the shape of an n x n grid. 
The groove in the ith row and jth column has a shade of a colour with 
darkness represented by a non-negative integer ai, j.

You want to make this palette as dark as possible but not make any colour
darker than the darkest colour already present in its corresponding row and column.
In one step, you can increase the darkness of any one colour by 1.

Find the number of steps it will take to make all colours in the palette as dark as possible.

Note: the changes are performed independently; none of them changes the palette for the next step.

Input Format
The first line of the input consists of a single integer n – the length and breadth of the palette.

The next n lines contain n space-separated integers each. The jth number in the ith line is ai,
 j – the darkness of colour in the ith row and jth column of the palette.

Output Format
Print a single integer – the number of steps it would take to make the palette as dark as possible.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

0 <= ai, j<= 100

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
3
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

Testcase Output
0
Explanation
No colour in the matrix can be made any darker.
 So, the answer would be 0.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
4
3 0 8 4
2 4 5 7
9 2 6 3
0 3 1 0

Testcase Output
35
Explanation
The final palette would be –


8 4 8 7


7 4 7 7


9 4 8 7


3 3 3 3


We can find the difference between each corresponding element both 
the grids (original and new) which gives the answer as 35.
